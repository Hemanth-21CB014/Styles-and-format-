        <h4><b>Snapdragon</b></h4>
        <p style="background-color: aquamarine;">Snapdragon is a brand of mobile system-on-chips (SoCs) developed by Qualcomm, which are used in many popular smartphones. The latest Snapdragon SoC for mobiles is the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1.
            The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 is built on a 4nm process and features an octa-core CPU with a tri-cluster architecture. It consists of four Cortex-X2 high-performance cores running at up to 3.2 GHz, three Cortex-A710 cores running at up to 2.7 GHz, and one Cortex-A510 efficiency core running at up to 1.8 GHz. This allows for smooth multitasking, faster app load times, and improved overall performance.
            The SoC also includes an Adreno 730 GPU, which provides a 30% improvement in graphics performance compared to the previous generation. It supports up to 8K display resolution and HDR10+.
            The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 also includes a Snapdragon X65 5G modem, which supports both sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G bands. It also supports Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2, as well as dual-SIM 5G connectivity.
            The SoC is designed to offer advanced camera capabilities, including support for up to 200-megapixel cameras and simultaneous triple-camera streams. It also includes a sixth-generation Qualcomm AI Engine, which offers up to 32 TOPS (trillion operations per second) of AI performance.
            Overall, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 is an advanced mobile SoC that provides powerful performance, advanced connectivity, and improved camera capabilities. It is expected to be used in many high-end smartphones in the coming year.</p>

                        Qualcomm is an American multinational corporation headquartered in San Diego, California,
                        and incorporated in Delaware. It creates semiconductors, software, and services related 
                        to wireless technology. It owns patents critical to the 5G, 4G, CDMA2000, TD-SCDMA and 
                        WCDMA mobile communications standards. Qualcomm was established in 1985 by Irwin M. Jacobs 
                        and six other co-founders. Its early research into CDMA wireless cell phone technology was 
                        funded by selling a two-way mobile digital satellite communications system known as Omnitracs.
